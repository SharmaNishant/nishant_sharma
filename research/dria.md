**Timeline:** (Oct, 2016 â€“ Present)

**Guides:** *Dr. Sebastian Elbaum*, and *Dr. Carrick Detweiler*


## Problem Definition

What component(s) in a robotic system are affected by a rate change(s)? 

## Current Techniques 

Our previously proposed static impact analysis technique addresses the problem from robotic systems point of view but there are a lot of static analysis limitations that we wish to eliminate. For example, high false negatives due to the over conservative nature of static analysis or information gap generated due to the configuration files sitting outside the scope of the static analysis.

## Proposed Technique

**Under Construction**

## Study

We analyzed two systems Care-O-Bot (Simulation), and Water Sampler. We can reduce the impact sets by up to 47%, and 41%.
