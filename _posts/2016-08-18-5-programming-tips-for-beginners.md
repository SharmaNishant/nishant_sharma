**The website is under construction and will receive a big update soon. Meanwhile, you can have a look at my [cv here](/cv/).**


<!-- I took this topic just because people often ask me about ways to improve programming skills or learn programming. I am not a great programmer or something, but I think I have some decent programming skills, and I can talk about some programming tips for beginners.

There are some points which might help you in improving your skills:

1.  First rule of programming is don't start writing a solution as soon as you read a question, that way you will waste more time and will have more implementation problems. Best way is to first write down a basic algorithm in a pure communication language you prefer. Just make an algorithm first, then think of making code from there.

2. Read lots and lots of code and try to understand what and how techniques are implemented. What are the different ways/tricks in which a problem can be solved. Reading and understanding someone's code really helps a lot.

3. If you are really new to programming, then I would suggest that try some IDE first. IDEs really help because there you can find out many implemented by default so it will reduce some level of difficulty to start with. For Eg: Code::Blocks for C/C++,Netbeans / Eclipse for Java and Visual Studio for C#.

4. I will say that see some video tutorial for basics there are a lot tutorials for C, Java, C++, C#, Python etc.
Watching video tutorials are way much better than reading from books ( Specially beginners ).

5. Join CodeChef or similar site where you can get coding assignment where you can test your skills on their assignments. And coding and lots of coding is the only key to become a good programmer you cannot become a good programmer just by reading some books or watching some tutorials. So at the end of the day if you don't write code then everything else you are doing is pretty much in vain.

MUST: Join a question and answer site like Stackoverflow.com for asking questions about problems you face during coding or your normal doubts. Just make sure that before asking a question, you have searched for it's answering so that things don't repeat or get copied again and again unnecessarily. -->
