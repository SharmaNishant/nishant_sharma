## Research Interest

My research focuses on bringing software engineering closer to robotics. I examine robotic systems and modify the software engineering solutions to eliminate domain specific limitations. My research interests include Program Analysis, Software Verification and Validation, and Robotics. My past research interests include Swarm Robotics, Swarm Intelligence, Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Embedded Systems.
