Following is a brief list of projects I have worked on over the past few years.


## Internship

[**Flyport Firmware Optimization**](/projects/flyport/#flyport-wifi-internship) <br>
Optimized the source code of the Flyport WiFi module (an embedded module) for battery usage.  

## During Graduate studies (at UNL)

[**Swarm of Flying drones**]() <br> 
Developing an in house framework for controlling quad-rotors with a goal of being able to control 50-100 UAV's at a time. 

[**Controller for Ringo Robot**](/projects/ringo/) <br> 
Implemented a real-time safe library for the commercially available open-sourced educational robot Ringo.

[**DRIA - Dynamic Rate Impact Analysis**](/research/dria/) <br> 
Developed and implemented a parallel algorithm to previously developed impact analysis technique [RSIA](/research/rsia/) using dynamic program analysis. 
  
[**RSIA - Rate Static Impact Analysis**](/research/rsia/) <br> 
Developed and implemented an impact analysis technique using static program analysis targeted at robotic software systems.
  
[**Sudoku Solver using Search**](/projects/sudoku-solver/) <br> 
Developed a Sudoku solver that takes an input image and projects back the solved Sudoku back on the input image.
  
[**Indoor Drone flying Android app**](/projects/drone-fly/) <br> 
Developed an android application to communicate with the in house drone controller to be able to fly drones in a safer manner.
  
[**Selfie Stalker demo**](/projects/selfie-stalker/) <br> 
Developed an application as a demo project where a drone followed a person and tool pictures of them smiling. 
  
[**ESC-Java Compiler Implementation**](/projects/escjava-compiler/) <br> 
Implemented a compiler including an optimizer for ESC-Java, a strict subset of Java.

## During undergraduate studies (at IIIT-D)

[**Swarath - An Autonomous Car**](/projects/swarath/) <br> 
Worked as part of the Planning and control module for the Swarath team targeting the Mahindra Spark the Rise: Driverless Car challenge for last mile connectivity on Indian road scenarios.

[**Carbot - Swarm of small ground robots**](/projects/carbot/)  <br> 
Developed a swarm of ROS-based ground robots capable of navigating in a closed environment by utilizing inputs from different sensors like GPS, proximity, IR, etc.
 
[**MobilEye - Helping visually impaired walk**](/projects/mobileye/) <br> 
Developed an android application to help visually impaired walk by tracking their motion and providing information about the nearby obstacles using camera inputs.
 
[**MobIVRS - IVR System on mobile**](/projects/mobivrs/)  <br> 
Implemented an IVR system in an Android application, which can be used for different purposes like taking surveys, scheduling appointments, or as a personal voice mail server.
 
[**Twit-d-Movi - Sentiment Analysis for Movie related Tweets**](/projects/twit-d-movi/)  <br> 
Developed a web application that collects real-time tweets about a movie and classify the relevant ones into positive and negative.
 
[**iFM - IIITD Finance Management System**](/projects/ifm-iiitd/)  <br> 
Developed a finance management website for the people of IIIT-D. It was developed using Java servlets and was hosted on Google App Engine.
 
[**Flyport Ethernet Module Implementation**](/projects/flyport/#flyport-ethernet-independent-project)  <br> 
Developed the source code of the Flyport Ethernet module (an embedded system), being used for sensor data collection.
 
[**Ancestral Inference using DNA**](/projects/ancestral-inference/)  <br> 
Used Bayesian Phylogeographic clustering to estimate the time since the most recent common ancestor from a sample of sequences.
 
[**Automatic Room Light Controller**](/projects/auto-rlc/)  <br> 
Developed a electric circuit using PIC micro-controller to controller temperature and light in the room.
