<strike><p align="justify">I am a master's student in Computer Science at the <a href="http://unl.edu">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>. I am currently being supervised by both <a href="http://cse.unl.edu/~elbaum/content/">Dr. Sebastian Elbaum</a> and <a href="http://cse.unl.edu/~carrick/">Dr. Carrick Detweiler</a>. I am also a proud member of the <a href="http://nimbus.unl.edu/">NIMBUS lab</a>. Before this, I completed my undergraduate in Computer Science from <a href="http://iiitd.ac.in/">IIIT-Delhi</a>.</p>


<p align="justify">Apart from academics, I like traveling, photography, cycling, and dancing. Even right now I have traveled to the USA of higher studies. I am currently exploring different photography genres. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VditVp1-aY">Bhangra</a> (an Indian dance form) is one of my specialities. I have been performing bhangra as part of Diwali night at UNL for two years in a row now.</p>
