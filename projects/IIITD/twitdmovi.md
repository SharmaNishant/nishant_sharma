## Description

It is a web-based application developed as a Data Mining course project, that collects real-time tweets about a movie and classify the relevant ones into positive and negative. The aim is to obtain accurate results and require a high-quality training set of movie tweets, good quality features and a classifier that provides good accuracy and time performance.For the sentimental analysis, we tried different classifiers â€“ SVM, Naive Bayes, and MaxEntropy classifier with different n-grams model. We have used the LM (Language Model) classifier in our application.
